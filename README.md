# ALZDB
Alzheimer's disease, the commonest cause of dementia, is a growing global health concern with huge implications for individuals and society. The pathological hallmarks of AD include amyloid deposits and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in the brain. However, it remains controversial whether these hallmarks are the cause or consequence of the disease.

Here we developed the Alzheimer database (ALZDB), a comprehensive resource for Alzheimer research. Currently,ALZDB collected and integrated schizophrenia related data from the following source: genomic data (genome-wide significant SNPs and genes), transcriptomic data(differentially expressed genes and miRNAs),proteomic data(differentially expressed proteins and protein interaction network),epigenetic data(differential methylation sites and regions).

What's more, we apply in-depth analyses and systematic integration,including SNPs and genes annotation,meta analysis ,network and pathway analysis. All data is visualized so it is easy to understand. In particular, we built an online genome browser that presents most of the data in a user-friendly form.
